        <p class="">Urgent Care centers are setup to assist patients with an illness or injury that does not appear to
            be life-threatening, but also can't wait until the next day, or for primary care doctor to see them.

            For the days and hours that primary care physicians are closed, or for someone who does not have a primary
            care physician, urgent care centers provide easy access to quality healthcare without the hassle of
            emergency room.

            Urgent medical conditions are ones that are not considered emergencies but still require care within 24
            hours. Some examples of such conditions include:
        <ul>
            <li> Accidents and falls</li>
            <li>Sprains and strains</li>
            <li> Breathing difficulties (i.e. mild to moderate asthma)</li>
            <li> Bleeding/cuts â€” not bleeding a lot but requiring stitches</li>
            <li> Fever or flu</li>
            <li> Minor broken bones and fractures (i.e. fingers, toes)</li>
        </ul>
        Life-threatening emergencies, such as a heart attack or a serious head injury, require a visit to the
        Emergency Department
